![Hi there!](./github-banner.gif)

My name is Steve Russo. I love learning about many topics, but programming has a special place with me. Here is some more info on what I am working on!

- 🐳 I’m currently playing around with Kubernetes on AKS at [Microservices with K8s](https://github.com/sjrusso8/microservice-k8s-node)
- 🍓 I’m attempting to deploy my own kubernetes cluster on a fleet of raspiberry pi 4s.  More on that to come!
- 💨 I’m reviewing the nuances of Apache Airflow to pass the new certification exam by Astronomer [Airflow Certified](https://www.astronomer.io/certification/)
- 📋 I’m looking to collaborate on any projects, and have strong experience with AWS and Azure. Feel free to contribute!

**Small Note** It's mostly shell right now because of Docker as it slowly becomes the core deployment method to most of my projects
